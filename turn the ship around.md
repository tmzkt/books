# Turn the Shiop Around!
**Louis David Marquet (2012)**
- A true story of turning followers into leaders

## Part 1: Starting Over
### 1. Pain
- Previous officer on ship ran around like crazy making sure everything was right - lots of time, everything relied on officer, but the ship's inspection went well
- The author did not want that policy. Instead he tried to empwer the people on the ship which became a leader-follower structure with "do what you are told, but..." and he failed the inspection due to a mistake.
### 2. Business as Usual
- It doesn't matter how smart a plan is if the team can't exeucte it
- Captain's leadership effectiveness not associated with how well his unit performed after he left or if his people get promoted 2-3 years later. All that mattered was performance in the moment.
- When the performance of a unit goes down after an officer leaves, it is a sign that he was a good leader, not that he was ineffective in training his people properly.
- People get comfortable with being a cog "Hey, I was only doing what I was told"
### 3. Change of Course
- Great leadership is giving a specific goal, but not telling you how to do it.
### 4. Frustration
- Be as curious as possible with people in your organization
- When becoming a new leader, interview the people and ask questions like "what would you do if you were me?", "what are your impediments?", "what should be changed?"
### 5. Call to Action
- Instead of doing assigned technical paperwork, he just spent time with the people
- People on the ship were frustrated. They wanted to change things but weren't being heard.
- They adopted a hunker down model where there primary goal was do the minimum and avoid mistakes.
- One sailor's request for vacation needed to be singed by 7 people! And it was sitting in someone's inbox! The system had failed, not the people.
### 5. "Whatever they tell me to do!"
- The problem wasn't an absence of leadership. It was too much leadership of the wrong kind, the leader-follower kind.
- The costs of leader-follower were observable in the passivity of sailors, the lack of initiative, waiting for others, and the department head paralysis without the CO at meetings.
### 7. "I relieve you!"
- 1. the crew wanted change, 2. a supportive chain of command allowed freedom, 3. his lack of knowledge of the ship prevented him from falling into old habits of telling people what to do
- Ships are evaluated based on the mistakes they make, "Your reward is no punishment"
- Focusing on avoiding mistakes takes our focus away from becoming truly exceptional.
- ACHIEVE EXCELLENCE, DON'T JUST AVOID ERRORS is a mechanism for CLAIRY (book to read is Simon Sinek's "Start with Why")
