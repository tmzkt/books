# Turn the Shiop Around!
**Louis David Marquet (2012)**
- A true story of turning followers into leaders

## Part 1: Starting Over
### 1. Pain
- Previous officer on ship ran around like crazy making sure everything was right - lots of time, everything relied on officer, but the ship's inspection went well
- The author did not want that policy. Instead he tried to empwer the people on the ship which became a leader-follower structure with "do what you are told, but..." and he failed the inspection due to a mistake.
### 2. Business as Usual
- It doesn't matter how smart a plan is if the team can't exeucte it
- Captain's leadership effectiveness not associated with how well his unit performed after he left or if his people get promoted 2-3 years later. All that mattered was performance in the moment.
- When the performance of a unit goes down after an officer leaves, it is a sign that he was a good leader, not that he was ineffective in training his people properly.
- People get comfortable with being a cog "Hey, I was only doing what I was told"
### 3. Change of Course
- Great leadership is giving a specific goal, but not telling you how to do it.
## Part 2: Control
