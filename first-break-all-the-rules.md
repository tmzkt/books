# First, Break All The Rules
**Marcus Buckingham & Curt Coffman (1999)**
- What the world's greatest managers do differently
- Based on in-depth interviews by the Gallup Organization of over 80,000 managers in over 400 companies - the largest study of its kind ever undertaken

## Chapter 1: The Measuring Stick
- People are demanding a simple and accurate measuring stick for comparing the strengths of one workplace to another. The Gallup Organization set out to build one.
- 12 questions measure the core elements needed to attract, focus, and keep the most talented employees
  1. Do I know what is expected of me at work?
  2. Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
  3. At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
  4. In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for doing good work?
  5. Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?
  6. Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
  7. At work, do my opinions seem to count?
  8. Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel my job is important?
  9. Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?
  10. Do I have a best friend at work?
  11. In the last six months, has someone at work talked to me about my progress?
  12. This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?
- Gallup performed a meta-analysis that linked employee opinion to the 4 business outcomes (productivity, profit, retention, customer service)
  1. Employees who responded more positively to the 12 questions also worked in business units with better business outcomes
  2. Employees rated the questions differently depending which business unit, not which company - opinions were being formed by immediate manager, not company
- Managers trump companies / immediate manager more important than company / empoyees leave managers, not companies
## Chapter 2: The Wisdom of Great Managers
- One shared thing among great managers - they try to help each person become and more of who he already is
- Great managers do not believe everyone has unlimited potential, they do not help people fix their weaknesses and they reject the "Golden Rule", and play favorites
- What great managers do - they are a "catalyst" - use employee's talents for company goals
- To be a successful catalyst, do 4 things well (the Four Keys of great managers)
  1. select a person...select for talent...not based on his experience, intelligence, and determination
  2. set expectations...by defining the right outcomes....not by defining the right steps
  3. motivate the person...by focusing on strengths...not by helping him identify and overcome his weaknesses
  4. develop the person...by finding the right fit...not by helping him learn and get promoted
## Chapter 3: The First Key: Select for Talent
- Talent is a recurring feeling, thought, or behavior that can be used in an effective way
- Every job lends itself to a unique set of talents and, therefore, requires a person with those talents to fill the role.
- Talent can’t be taught (e.g. empathy, confidence). Talents are developed at a young age and can’t be changed after your teenage years because of the way the brain works.
- You need to hire people that already possess the necessary talents for the position.
- Skills vs Knowledge vs Talents - Skills and Knowledge can be taught. 
- 3 categories of talents:
  1. Striving (e.g. ambition, altruism, competitiveness, and mastery)
  2. Thinking (e.g. discipline, flexibility, focus, logic)
  3. Relating (e.g. socializing, empathy, trust, confrontation)
- To find great talent, two tips:
  1. know what talents you are looking for - what fits with company, team, and your management style. To make it easier, choose 1 talent from each cateogry to evaluate
  2. study your best - learn from your top performers
## Chapter 4: The Second Key: Define the Right Outcomes
- How to retain control and focus on performance while you cannot force everyone to perform in the same way? Define the right outcomes and then let each person find his own route towards those outcomes.
- Rules of thumb
  1. Don't break the bank - employees must follow certain required steps for all aspects of their role that deal with accuracy or safety
  2. Standards rule - employees must follow required steps when those steps are part of a company or industry standard
  3. Don't let the creed overshadow the message - required steps are useful only if they do not obscure the desired outcome
  4. There are no steps leading to customer satisfaction - required steps only prevent dissatisfaction. They cannot drive customer satisfaction.
- To define the right outcomes, think 1. what is right for your customers? 2. what is right for your company? 3. what is right for the individual?
## Chapter 5: The Third Key: Focus on Strengths
- To develop a stronger workplace, you have to reject the concept of “transformation,” build up talents, and navigate around weaknesses.
- Focus on each person's strengths and manage around his weaknesses. Don't try to fix the weaknesses. Help each person become ore of who he already is.
- A great manager can describe, in detail, the unique talents of each of his or her people
- Great managers identify talents and help cultivate those talents in 3 ways
  1. Casting is everything - position each person so that you are paying her to do what she is naturally wired to do. Cast her in the right role.
  2. Manage by exception - treat each person as he would like to be treated. Do this by asking about goals and preferences to each individual.
  3. Spend the most time with their best people - the fairest thing to do, the best way to learn, and the only way to stay focused on excellence
- Top performers have the most potential for growth
- To manage around a weakness, ask
  1. is the poor performance trainable and due to a lack of skills or knowledge? IF so, train them.
  2. Is the nonperformance caused by the mamager himself tripping the wrong trigger? What motivates the person?
- 3 approaches manage around a weakness
  1. devise a support system (can't remember names - get rolodex, can't count - bring in packages with no counting involved)
  2. Find a complementary partner (match up one person's valleys with another's peaks)
  3. Find an alternative role
## Chapter 6: The Fourth Key: Find the Right Fit
- Employees inevitably want to "climb the ladder" and get promoted in their careers. But then, most employees are promoted to their level of incompetence.
- One rung doesn't necessarily lead to another
- Create heroes in every role - so that employees aren't tempted to climb into the next rung if it's not a good fit. Use broadbanding (broad bands of pay) to reward for excellence.
- Varied experiences do not make the employee more attractive
- Great managers level the playing field - create an environment where money and prestige are spread throughout
- Great managers hold up the mirror - 1. give constant feedback 2. each session began with a brief review of past performance 3. give feedback in private, one on one
- Great managers create a safety net - use trial periods to see if employee a good fit
- Use tough love - balance high performance standards and the need to care
## Chapter 7: Turning the Keys: A Practical Guide
- The art of interviewing for talent
  1. Make sure the talent interview stands alone - let candidate know you that part of the interview will be about discovering talents
  2. Ask a few open-ended questions and then keep quiet - believe these un-aided responses to the questions
  3. Listen for specifics - if the candidate is specific, it is likely a recurring behavior (talent). If they are not specific, it is likely just theory.
  4. Clues to talent - 1. ask what roles they have been able to learn quickly - this will tell you how quickly they learn 2. ask what greatest personal satisfaction is, what do they find fulfilling - this will tell you what they can consistently do week to week
  5. Know what to listen for - keep track of employee performance and how they answered interview questions and look for patterns to continue selecting for talent.
- 4 characteristics common to the "performance management" routines of great managers
  1. The routine is simple
  2. The routine forces frequent interaction - don't have to drop "bombs" on employees or surprise them, easier to remember examples of perfomrance, it gets reinforced
  3. The routine is focused on the future
  4. The routine askss the employee to keep track of his own performance and learnings - rather than employee being passive, make them accountable, the point is self-discovery. Research revelas students stay in school longer and learn more if they are expected to record their own progress.
- Master Keys - What can a company do to create a friendly climate for great managers
  1. Keep the focus on outcomes (define role using outcomes, find a way to measure outcomes, hold managers accountable for employees' responses to the 12 questions)
  2. Value world-class performance in every role (within roles, set up levels of achievement and reward with plaques/certificates/displomas, set up broadband compensation plans, celebrate personal bests)
  3. Study your best (build talent profile of best performers, revise training to incorporate what you learn, set up internal "university")
  4. Teach the language of great managers (teach 4 keys of great managers, change job descriptions to reflect talent, revise training to train for skills and knowledge and not talents, send most talented to training for skills and knowledge to complement their talents, don't send least talented to be "fixed", give employee's feedback, use great manager's "performance management" routine)
