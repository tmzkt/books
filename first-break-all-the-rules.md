# First, Break All The Rules
**Marcus Buckingham & Curt Coffman (1999)**
- What the world's greatest managers do differently
- Based on in-depth interviews by the Gallup Organization of over 80,000 managers in over 400 companies - the largest study of its kind ever undertaken

## Chapter 1: The Measuring Stick
- People are demanding a simple and accurate measuring stick for comparing the strengths of one workplace to another. The Gallup Organization set out to build one.
- 12 questions measure the core elements needed to attract, focus, and keep the most talented employees
  1. Do I know what is expected of me at work?
  2. Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
  3. At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
  4. In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for doing good work?
  5. Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?
  6. Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
  7. At work, do my opinions seem to count?
  8. Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel my job is important?
  9. Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?
  10. Do I have a best friend at work?
  11. In the last six months, has someone at work talked to me about my progress?
  12. This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?
- Gallup performed a meta-analysis that linked employee opinion to the 4 business outcomes (productivity, profit, retention, customer service)
  1. Employees who responded more positively to the 12 questions also worked in business units with better business outcomes
  2. Employees rated the questions differently depending which business unit, not which company - opinions were being formed by immediate manager, not company
- Managers trump companies / immediate manager more important than company / empoyees leave managers, not companies
## Chapter 2: The Wisdom of Great Managers
- One shared thing among great managers - they try to help each person become and more of who he already is
- Great managers do not believe everyone has unlimited potential, they do not help people fix their weaknesses and they reject the "Golden Rule", and play favorites
- What great managers do - they are a "catalyst" - use employee's talents for company goals
- To be a successful catalyst, do 4 things well (the Four Keys of great managers)
  1. select a person...select for talent...not based on his experience, intelligence, and determination
  2. set expectations...by defining the right outcomes....not by defining the right steps
  3. motivate the person...by focusing on strengths...not by helping him identify and overcome his weaknesses
  4. develop the person...by finding the right fit...not by helping him learn and get promoted
## Chapter 3: The First Key: Select for Talent
- Talent is a recurring feeling, thought, or behavior that can be used in an effective way
- Every job lends itself to a unique set of talents and, therefore, requires a person with those talents to fill the role.
- Talent can’t be taught (e.g. empathy, confidence). Talents are developed at a young age and can’t be changed after your teenage years because of the way the brain works.
- You need to hire people that already possess the necessary talents for the position.
- Skills vs Knowledge vs Talents - Skills and Knowledge can be taught. 
- 3 categories of talents:
- Striving (e.g. ambition, altruism, competitiveness, and mastery)
- Thinking (e.g. discipline, flexibility, focus, logic)
- Relating (e.g. socializing, empathy, trust, confrontation)
- To find great talent, two tips:
  1. know what talents you are looking for - what fits with company, team, and your management style. To make it easier, choose 1 talent from each cateogry to evaluate
  2. study your best - learn from your top performers
